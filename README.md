# Web-based Data Extraction and Analysis AI

The Web-based Data Extraction and Analysis AI is a Python project that aims to provide users with a versatile tool for collecting valuable information from websites. By leveraging popular libraries like BeautifulSoup and Google APIs, this project enables users to extract, process, and analyze data from the web without the need for local files.

## Key Features

1. **Web Data Extraction**: The AI-based program utilizes the BeautifulSoup library to scrape web pages and extract structured data such as text, images, and tables. Users can specify the websites, URLs, or search queries as inputs to gather data accordingly.

2. **Google Search API Integration**: The project integrates Google APIs to enable advanced web searches and specific information collection from search results. By utilizing the Google Search API, the program retrieves relevant data from various sources and presents it in a structured manner.

3. **Data Processing and Analysis**: Once the data is collected, the program applies various data processing techniques to clean and transform the extracted data. Users have the flexibility to perform custom data manipulation operations such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, and analyzing data to derive meaningful insights.

4. **Data Visualization**: The project incorporates popular Python libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to provide users with interactive and visually appealing data visualizations. Users can generate plots, charts, and graphs to better understand the extracted data and communicate their findings effectively.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**: The program is designed with a user-friendly command-line interface or a web-based interface using Python frameworks like Flask or Django. Users can interact with the program seamlessly, input search queries, specify websites to scrape, and customize data analysis options effortlessly.

6. **Easy Deployment**: The entire project is developed and deployed as a web application, eliminating the need for local files. Users can access and utilize the system from any device with an internet connection.

## Possible Extensions

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Implement sentiment analysis techniques to extract sentiments from text data collected during web scraping. This can be useful for analyzing user opinions, feedback, or reviews.
- **Real-time Data Scraping**: Integrate web scraping functions with scheduling capabilities to allow users to collect data at regular intervals automatically.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to train predictive models using the extracted data for making future predictions or classifications.

## Usage

### Web Data Extraction

```python
from web_extraction import WebScraper

# Creating an instance of the WebScraper class
scraper = WebScraper(base_url)

# Scraping text data from the base URL
text_data = scraper.scrape_text()

# Scraping images from the base URL
image_urls = scraper.scrape_images()

# Scraping tables from the base URL
table_data = scraper.scrape_tables()
```

### Google Search API Integration

```python
from google_api import GoogleSearchAPI

# Creating an instance of the GoogleSearchAPI class
google_api = GoogleSearchAPI(api_key, cse_id)

# Searching for a query and retrieving search results
search_results = google_api.search(query)
```

### Data Processing and Analysis

```python
from data_processing import DataProcessor

# Creating an instance of the DataProcessor class
data_processor = DataProcessor()

# Filtering data based on criteria
filtered_data = data_processor.filter_data(data, criteria)

# Sorting data based on selected columns
sorted_data = data_processor.sort_data(data, sort_by)

# Aggregating data based on selected columns and aggregations
aggregated_data = data_processor.aggregate_data(data, group_by, aggregations)

# Analyzing data using descriptive statistics
data_analysis = data_processor.analyze_data(data)
```

### Data Visualization

```python
from data_visualization import DataVisualizer

# Creating an instance of the DataVisualizer class
data_visualizer = DataVisualizer()

# Generating a plot
data_visualizer.generate_plot(data, x, y)

# Generating an interactive plot
data_visualizer.generate_interactive_plot(data, x, y)
```

## Web Interface (Flask)

This project also provides a web interface for easy interaction with the program. To run the web application, execute the following commands:

```bash
cd web-interface
python app.py
```

The web application can be accessed at http://localhost:5000/.
